3)) A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

Creating stored procedure:

CREATE PROCEDURE SelectSpecial
AS
SELECT CONCAT(EmployeesTable.FIRST_NAME,'  ' ,EmployeesTable.LAST_NAME),
EmployeesTable.designation, max(VARIABLES_AMOUNT.VariablesDetails) AND MIN(VARIABLES_AMOUNT.VariablesDetails)
FROM EmployeesTable, VariablesDetails
WHERE EmployeesTable.EMP_
ID  = VariablesDetails.EMP_REF_ID;

GO;



Executing the stored procedure::;


EXEC SelectSpecial;
